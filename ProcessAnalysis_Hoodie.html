                    <h3>Problem: Representing SIAT </h3>
                    <p>The Interactive Arts and Technology Program at SFU is an interdisciplinary research-focused school covering a broad variety of fields. We had to research and iterate ways to best represent SIAT and create a design to fit our consumerâ€™s clothing style and the professional standard of the administration board.  </p>

                    <h3>Strategy: Research and Framing</h3>
                    <p>Being that our target audience were SIAT student, we research how we can best represent the students in the program. With Kaia and I being third-year students of IAT, we looked at relatable behavior's  of our peers. Our aim was to create a hoodie that fit the style of young adults, while illustrating what IAT was without it being too corporate and childlike. We looked into designing a hoodie for casual wear that students can wear outside of a school setting. </p>

                    <h3>Strategy: art direction </h3>
                    <p>After discussing the concept and target vision of the hoodie with my teammate, I looked at precedents and began iterations. I looked at concert merchandises, illustration art such as line art, graphics and icons.</p>

                    <h3>Strategy: iterations of layout styles</h3>
                    <p>We landed with a minimalistic style for the front using Typography and a line art illustration for the backside. We created a character in the shape of a brain/thought bubble to represent the creativity of the students. The character is wearing a headphone and staring at a laptop screen as it was a common appearance seen in the IAT studio rooms.</p>

                    <h3>Strategy: testing color combinations</h3>
                    <p>given the constraints of only three colors, we decided to go with a sky blue monochromatic color scheme for cohesiveness. Sky Blue was chosen to relate to the vast sky to show endless possibilities and symbolize clarity, calmness and understanding.</p>

                    <h3>Challenges: Miscommunications</h3>
                    <p>From this project, I learned how important constant communication is between all parties. One challenge we faced was miscommunication between the criteria we were told and what was needed from the production company. The criteria for the hoodie design conflicted with the limitations of production which let to us editing our design multiple times.</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>Creating a design for a product with one of my closest friends and seeing it made into production was incredibly rewarding. We worked through countless hours of meeting online and in-person to ideate and get our peers feedback during the process. 
                    <br><br>
                    This being a side passion project we took on,  I found an interest in product design. I learned to have confidence in my skills and that the foundation to a successful design was communication. It was important to align our goals and figure out what each person wanted out of the project along with the direction we wanted to follow. This allowed a smooth transition to providing each other feedback and collaborating together. </p>
