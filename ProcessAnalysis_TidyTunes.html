                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>Our device aims to create a fun interactive clean up environment in the household or in a learning space, for children ages 2 to 6. The device will teach children to continue good habits of cleaning after themselves. Our device will positively encourage children to see cleaning up as a game rather than a chore. TidyTunes can be placed in indoor play areas eg. bedroom, living room, classrooms and interacted individually or as a group. We have set the duration of playtime and clean up to be manually inputed by the user (the guardians for the children). </p>

                    <h3>Problem: How might we...?</h3>
                    <p>Here were some questions we asked ourselves to find solutions to:
                        <li>How might we teach toddlers how to clean up their environment while keeping them entertain?</li>
                        <li>How might we excite children to start cleaning up without feeling overwhelmed by the task?</li>
                        <li>how might we engage and motivate children to clean up after themselves? </li>

                    <h3>Strategy: Prototyping + delegating roles</h3>
                    <p>The first step was creating a prototype of our device. We had two pieces, the base and the basket. Next was to create the processing and Arduino code to be implemented. During this step we had delegated responsibilities based on skillsets and what each team member wanted to gain and take charge. </p>

                    <p>I took on the visual and set design role and lead the team on the design end. I worked on poster design, the exhibition set up, the digital interface of the game and project documentation and slides.

                    <p>Overall, I believe our team had created a viable device that could be implemented in the future for children if we do decide to continue this project further. We received positive feedback from our peers, professor, teacher assistant and the audience during our exhibition presentation.<b> Here is a video of our project https://youtu.be/QBAe5NFP4zg</b>
